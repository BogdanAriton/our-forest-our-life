# Overall high level description of the project:
1. Why?

    Forest inventory is something that, when done manually, can be a pain. While not enough people are available for the manual job or lack of trining, these people can be easily corrupted because they earn next to no money. This leads to illegal cutting and eventually mass deforestation. 
    In terms of figures Romania is on the bottom of the list with less than 32% forest coverage while being one of the largest countries in Europe, but I'm NOT here to discuss why Romania is this situation, this rabbit hole as been dug by some of the greatest independent reporting organization called Recorder (some of their investigations can be watched here: __links_to_recorder), I'm here to discuss and propose a solution for this problem.

2. How?

    Automating the inventory process has been studied in depth and I'm by no means an expert on this subject 

3. What?
